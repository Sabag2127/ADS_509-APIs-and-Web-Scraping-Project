## Project Description and Objectives 
The purpose of this machine learning project is to classify restaurant reviews as positive or
negative. The negative and positive reviews can be further analyzed to determine the top 5-10
words associated with the reviews, so that the restaurants can identify what it is that they are doing
well and what it is that they need to improve on. Overall, this classification is to be carried out to
aid restaurants with efficiently identifying what they need to do to increase their ratings without
reading through each comment.
## Machine Learning Goals 
* Create machine learning algorithms that can accurately classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative. 
* Determine the top words associated with positive and negative reviews   
## Business Goals 
* Create a model to determine whether a review is positive or negative
* Help restaurants efficiently determine what is causing negative and positive customer sentiments 
* Employ predictive model within 7 weeks from start date (May 9th, 2023 - June 27th, 2023)
